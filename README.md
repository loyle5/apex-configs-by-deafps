# APEX CONFIGS & TWEAKS
# Autoexec
1. Go to the games directory. (Usually in C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\Apex\cfg)

3. Paste everything from [autoexec](https://github.com/deaFPS/Apex/blob/master/autoexec.cfg) in it.
4. Rightclick on the game inside of Origin and go to "Game Properties".
5. Switch to the "Advanced Launch Options" Tab.
6. Add the Command line argument "+exec autoexec.cfg" (without the Quotation marks)
# Videoconfig
1. Press Win+R while you are on your desktop.
2. Paste this inside the Run box: "%USERPROFILE%\Saved Games\Respawn\Apex\local" (without the Quotation marks)
3. Open up the Videoconfig.txt with Wordpad or Notepad++.
4. Replace everything in it with the code from [videoconfig](https://github.com/deaFPS/Apex/blob/master/videoconfig.txt)
5. Save and make the file read-only. (also make sure your Origin Cloud Sync is disabled in the origin settings)
# Consistant frame caping
Use RTSS for framerate caping over build-in game engines caps. RTSS is the best in frametime consistancy.

Do not use a higher cap value than 190 FPS since the game will introduce stutter (its a apex bug)
